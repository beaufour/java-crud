# Simple Spring + Thymeleaf Example

This is a simple example of a Spring Boot application using Thymeleaf as the view engine.

It retrieves a list of bars from Postgres, and you can see the list and the individual bars. Nothing particular fancy for sure :)

It expects Postgres to be running on localhost (tweak that in application.properties).

You run it with:

> ./gradlew bootRun

And then you can see the app here [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).
